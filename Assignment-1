1.What is python? What are the ways to install python?

Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.

2. What are Code Environments ? What are different Types ?

A code environment is the area where you write, compile, execute, debug or see output of the code.
There are 3 different types of code environments:
1) Text Editors : Editor used for writing general text file. ex- Notepad,VS code etc.

2) Full IDEs : Suitable for writing large codes with lots of extra facilities for programming languages and designed specifically for a programming language. For ex – Pycharm for Python,Eclipse for Java etc.

3) Notebook Environments:It is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code. Here you can see input and output next to each other.For ex –Jupyter Notebook.
